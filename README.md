Hi! Welcome to my philosophy blog, Letters from Philosophy. I created this blog to share my thoughts on various philosophy related topics and hear your thoughts as well. No need to have any experience with philosophy, just enthusiasm and willingness to learn! 
I used the create-react-app boilerplate to make this blog and added three react routes you can navigate through (home, all posts, and each individual post). Just click on a specific post title/synopsis in the all posts view to see the content of that specific post. There's also a comments section of each post where you can submit a comment and a delete button for each comment in case you would like to delete a comment you previously posted.
